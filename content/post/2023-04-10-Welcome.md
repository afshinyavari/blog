Hello and welcome to my blog. In this blog I will document what I do when I have some time to spare trying out different open source software.

Last year I built my own server from used parts which I purchased on ebay. It's a dual cpu motherboard with two intel Xeon e5 2680 v4 each with 14 cores and 28 threads, 512 GB DDR4 ECC ram and 2 TB SSD disk, running VmWare ESXI for virtualization.

I used to run a vanilla Kubernetes cluster on my server but I've deleted everything and my goal is to setup a K3s kluster with 3 masters and 3 worker nodes. I will run ArgoCD for continious delivery and a Gitea-instance with Gitea actions for continious integration. Later on I'm going to run a Redpanda kluster, which is a Kafka-cluster built in C++ and deploy some Kafka-streams applications. I also have a desire to explore the Java Operator-SDK for building Operators on Kubernetes.

I hope you will enjoy the content, See you next time!
